/**
 * Blocking JSON-LD gate on the SHIPPED output.
 *
 * Why this exists alongside scripts/validate_jsonld.py: that one runs at
 * checkout on committed source and skips build directories by design. The
 * corruption that actually reached Google, Search Console "Unparsable
 * structured data / Parsing error: Missing ',' or '}'" on voicelogpro.com,
 * 2026-07-25, is introduced *between* the repo and the deployed page, by
 * the centrally generated pSEO pages and by build-time post-processors. A
 * source-only lint structurally cannot see that class of bug.
 *
 * Two distinct causes produced that one Search Console message:
 *
 *   "@context":"https://***@type":"WebPage"     <- `schema.org","` clobbered,
 *   "@context":"https://schema.org","@type":…      swallowing @type
 *
 *   "mainEntity":[…]`}                         <- leftover JS template-literal
 *   "mainEntity":[…]}                             backtick closing a FAQPage
 *
 * Both are checked by signature as well as by JSON.parse, because a repair
 * step with no verification after it is worse than no repair: it lets a new
 * variant of the corruption ship silently. Blocks that parse but whose
 * @context was corrupted are caught too, since JSON.parse waves those through.
 *
 * Node, not Python, on purpose: every deploy path runs the build (Vercel cloud
 * builds, and local `vercel build && vercel deploy --prebuilt` alike) and node
 * is guaranteed in all of them, while python3 is not.
 *
 * Self-contained by design, no cross-repo import, so it works in Vercel's
 * shallow clone. Keep the copies in the 10 site repos identical.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/verify-jsonld.mjs [dir ...]
 *   Default target: vercel.json's `outputDirectory`, the tree that actually
 *   ships. Exit 1 on any bad block, or if a named directory does not exist.
 *
 * The default was hardcoded to `dist` until 2026-07-25, which is wrong on every
 * site that deploys from the repo root. This site has `outputDirectory: "."` and
 * no dist/ at all, so an argument-less run did not lint the wrong tree, it
 * exited 1 with `dist not found, run the build first`, on a site that has no
 * build. Same misdirected default as churnlens (where it linted 78 stale
 * .vercelignored pages instead of the 294 real ones), just a louder failure.
 * Reading `outputDirectory` keeps the copies in the 10 site repos identical AND
 * correct per-site (this site ".", voicelogpro "dist").
 *
 * Note for this repo specifically: vercel.json's `buildCommand` *is* this gate
 * (`node scripts/verify-jsonld.mjs .`), so it runs on every deploy, which is
 * also why `scripts/` cannot be .vercelignored here, unlike churnlens and
 * carshake: the file has to exist in the build container.
 *
 * See ~/.growth-engine/GUARDRAILS.md rule 3 for the portfolio-wide context and
 * ~/.growth-engine/validate-jsonld-live.py for the post-deploy live check.

// .vercelignore is the authority on what ships, so honour it rather than letting
// the hardcoded list above drift away from it. Deliberately narrow: only bare
// top-level directory names (`dist/`, `scripts/`, `/aeo`), never globs or nested
// paths. A single leading slash is stripped, it is the .vercelignore idiom for
// "top level only", and carshake's file is written entirely in that style, so
// rejecting it would silently honour nothing there.
//
// Currently a no-op in this repo: .vercelignore holds one entry, `spec.md`, and
// it is not a directory. Kept identical to the other copies anyway, the point of
// this function is that the skip list cannot drift from what Vercel obeys, and
// that guarantee is worth having before the file grows rather than after.
//
// This is the one place where the gate is allowed to shrink its own surface, so
// it is a real hazard: a green gate bought by narrowing coverage looks identical
// to a green gate that checked everything. Two things keep it honest, the names
// come from the same file Vercel obeys (so anything skipped is genuinely
// unrequestable), and every skipped name is printed on every run, so the surface
// is visible in the log instead of implied. An explicitly named directory is
// still always scanned.
